## Employee Data Structure

### Employee Fields
```javascript
{
  employeeId: String (unique),
  fullName: String,
  designation: String,
  qualifications: {
    ug: String,
    pg: String,
    phd: String
  },
  dateOfBirth: Date,
  dateOfJoining: Date,
  previousExperience: {
    years: Number,
    months: Number,
    days: Number
  }
}
```

### Auto-calculated Fields
```javascript
{
  age: Number, // Calculated from dateOfBirth
  currentExperience: {
    years: Number,
    months: Number,
    days: Number
  }, // Calculated from dateOfJoining to current date
  totalExperience: {
    years: Number,
    months: Number,
    days: Number
  } // Sum of current + previous experience
}
```

## Experience Calculation Logic

### Current Experience
- Calculated from `dateOfJoining` to current date
- Updates automatically in real-time
- Handles month boundaries properly (30 days = 1 month)

### Total Experience
- Sum of current experience and previous experience
- Automatically handles overflow (days ‚Üí months ‚Üí years)
- Recalculates when joining date or previous experience is updated

### Validation Rules
- Date of birth must be in the past
- Date of joining cannot be in the future
- Date of birth must be before date of joining
- Experience values cannot be negative
- Months cannot exceed 11
- Days cannot exceed 30

## User Roles & Permissions

### Admin Users
- Full access to employee management
- User credential management
- Create, edit, delete users
- Toggle user active/inactive status
- View admin dashboard with statistics
- Cannot deactivate or delete their own account

### Regular Users
